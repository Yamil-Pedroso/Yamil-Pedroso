Welcome to my GitHub profile 🤓! I am a full-stack developer with over 5+ years of experience building scalable, responsive, and user-focused applications across the web and artist passionate about technology and creativity.
 My technical expertise spans
frontend frameworks like React and backend technologies such as Node.js and Express,
with a strong foundation in modern architectures, REST APIs, and clean code practices.
In parallel, I am also a passionate digital and traditional artist. My background in
traditional and digital art brings a unique creative edge to my development work.
Whether I'm coding an interactive component or illustrating a concept, I strive to merge
functionality with aesthetic value.
