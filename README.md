Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ¤“! I am a full-stack developer and artist passionate about technology and creativity.

As a developer, I have worked on projects ranging from web and mobile applications to e-commerce platforms and content management systems. I have experience with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Python, Ruby and have worked with frameworks such as React, Django, Ruby on rails and the Runtime Environment Node.js.

As an artist, I love to create and explore new forms of expression. I use a variety of techniques and media, such as drawing, painting, and digital media, to bring my ideas to life.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, art techniques, read and play video games.
